## MarkdownWin

*A [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) editor with live-preview for Windows.*

I built this because [MarkedApp](http://www.markedapp.com) isn't available for Windows.
Like MarkedApp, MarkdownWin will monitor a file for changes and keep the live preview
in sync with your file. You can use whatever editor you want.

We use [MarkdownSharp](http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/) to render the live preview.

### Features

* Preview your Markdown file live, while you edit it.
* Copy the HTML source to your clipboard with `CTRL+C`.
* Print it with `CTRL+P`.
* Float the preview window on top of other applications for easy viewing.
